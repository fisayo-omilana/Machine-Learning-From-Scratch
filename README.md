# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
This is an implementation of the Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms without pre-made packages.
The probabilistic math (i.e. gradient ascent and the naive bayes assumption) behind the two machine learning techniques is coded within the scripts.
The code only handles binary inputs... for now.
